# On-Line Filtering of On-Street Parking Data to Improve Availability Predictions
*2019 6th International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)*

## Dataset
SFPark's public stationary sensors dataset

## Goal
Improving the quality of on-street parking availability predictions before training ML models

## Approach
Qualitative analysis of the noise in the data collected from stationary sensors of SFPark.

Kalman filter to de-noise the data

Support Vector Regressor is used on the cleansed data and Time of Day features
