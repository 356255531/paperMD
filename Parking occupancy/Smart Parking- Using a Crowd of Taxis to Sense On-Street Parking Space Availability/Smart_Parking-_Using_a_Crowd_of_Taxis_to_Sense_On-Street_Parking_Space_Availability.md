# Smart Parking: Using a Crowd of Taxis to Sense On-Street Parking Space Availability
*2019 IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*

## Dataset

### Ground truth
They used SFPark's public stationary sensors dataset

### Simulation
Taxi dataset of the Cab Spotting project is used to generate the simulated traversal of the high-mileage probe vehicles.

## Goal
To identify how much crowd-sensing of parking availability using probe vehicles can replace the expensive deployment of static parking sensors.

## Model 
Simple statistical comparison of the simulated and ground truth data in two settings of Probe Vehicle Data With/Without Misdetections to evaluate the impact of errors on the quality of the sensed availability information.
